# ynab
This repo is a ynab client implementation to interact with the ynab REST API's, written in Rust. There is another ynab rust API out there but it appears to be incomplete. This repo will eventually implement support for all api endpoints.

This is a work in progress. This README and code will get cleaned up in time.
